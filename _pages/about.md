I am a second-year **Ph.D. student** in [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/)

I will be visiting the [Language Technologies Institute (LTI)](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/) this year for a one-year research stay under the supervision of Prof. [Chenyan Xiong](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/).
