I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.cas.cn), advised by Prof. [Shenghua Liu](https://shenghua-liu.github.io). I am a member of [CAS Key Laboratory of AI Security](https://ict.cas.cn/jssgk/zzjg/kyxt/sjzn/js/). My research interests lie in the general area of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Learning.
